# Battleship
BattleShip game created with Sass, JS, and HTML. JS objects such as Gameboard and Ship were tested with Jest.

### Thoughts
This project pretty much utilized everything that I learned including babel, webpack and eslint. Utilized a test driven approach for making objects. Futher improvements could include making the computer smarter and not just make random moves. Also I could add drag and drop for making the ships.
